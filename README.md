The course "Fundamentals of wireless communications" gives an overview of theoretical methods that govern modern cellular communication systems design principles. The course covers basic signal transmission techniques: modulation, signal propagation over the wireless medium, synchronization, signal detection, and demodulation. The students will get familiar with modulation techniques used in 4th and 5th-generation cellular systems. Advanced topics include multiple antenna techniques (MIMO - Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) and multiuser communication. The practical part of the course includes a series of labs (MATLAB/Python). Each lab suggests conducting a numerical experiment to evaluate the performance of different communication techniques. This course relies on the "Digital signal processing" and "Information and coding theory" courses.
